# ScreenLife Capture Android App

This repo contains the Android Application used in the ScreenLife Capture study. The application allows participants to record and upload screenshots taken every X number of seconds. The general layout of the code is explained below.

### Features added by Univeristy of Notre Dame, Center for Research Computing

1.  GPS coordinate logging:  When the app is actively recording the screen images, it will also write JSON files of the user's location as \<hash\>_\<datetime\>_gps.json.  

2.  Foreground app info:  The app will use the OS process list to find the top application running, and record it to a JSON file, \<hash\>_\<datetime\>_foreground.json.
